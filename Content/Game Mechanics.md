# Game Mode Prototypes

### Intemperance Mode
Single/Multi-player experience. The game loop starts with the profit quota being generated and players choosing the island location, entering the island and gathering items/dealing with monsters. Players can choose to travel to another island or to return to "base". When players choose to return the cycle ends and players can sell the gathered items in exchange for gold. If the profit quota is reached a new cycle is initiated, if not, the game is lost.

##### 7-day cycle 
In the intemperance mode the crew has 7 days to reach the generated quota. Each day players can raid an island (either the same one or move to another), revive teammates and restore health. By the end of 7-day cycle the crew returns to the "base" island.

### Campaign (Rogue-lite)
Singe player, story-driven experience with all the pre-built maps set in a sequential order. Can be used as a tutorial to the intemperance mode. Similarly to other rogue-lite games, the character will have multiple lives. When the last life is expended, campaign is lost and the player has to start over.

### Smash'n'Grab
All purchasable equipment is free. Choose a pre-built or procedurally generated island and break in...

# Enemies
Islands are populated with different monsters. Monsters have different health pools, speed and sight range. Enemies will emmit light or sound ques for players to learn and exploit their behaviour.
### Difficulty
The monsters will vary by their rarity. Monsters' rarity is directly correlated with the level of danger the monster presents. Some monsters will be considered a mild annoyance will others will be feared.

# Damage and Character Death
Enemies, weapons and traps deal damage. Once the character's health pool reaches 0, the character falls unconscious. In the intemperance mode other players can carry their body to the ship and revive the character the next day. If the body is not returned to the ship, a monetary penalty is imposed on the crew but the character is revived.

# Stamina
Certain actions require stamina. Stamina is drained from the stamina pool and restores at a flat rate. Players have to manage their stamina pool to be effective in combat and other possible situations. **Examples of possible stamina-draining abilities**: melee weapon attack, jump, dodge, carrying a heavy object.

# Ambidextrity
Players will be able to utilize both hands of their character for different tasks and abilities. This will create a natural combo-mechanic where players will be able to combine the effects of certain weapons, potions and other items strongly weighing on the "coolness"-factor of their sailor.
