*** 
*Intemperance* is set in a dark, low, fantastic world resembling an [early modern period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_modern_period), where most of the planet's surface has been flooded, leaving little habitable land. Private ships sail to explore old, forgotten places of civilization in an attempt to find riches and sources of magic left by their ancestors.

The world of *Intemperance* will have a dark, evil tone of a declining civilization. Initial "campaign" levels will be set in an abandoned fort, a city that was populated not so long ago. Delving deeper, underground, will reveal a mausoleum, built by worship of the supernatural. Creatures to be encountered will follow this sinister theme. The player will also meet non-hostile characters who will give hints and information about the world.
