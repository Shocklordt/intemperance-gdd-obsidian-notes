The following is a proposal for a role-playing game with rogue-lite, multiplayer and extraction elements, with an emphasis on exploration, conflict and hardship. The essence of the game can be thought as a mashup of *Diablo(1997)* and *Lethal Company(2023)*. This initial document will be expanded upon and modified when development is initiated.

## Overview
*Intemperance* is a role playing game wherein a player plays a role of a singular sailor, and guides them through a dungeon in an attempt to find and collect expensive artifacts, survive, and bring items back to the ship. All the action takes place in isometric 3D dungeons and other environments.  The character faces challenges in the form of hostile monsters, traps and other environmental setbacks in a quest to fulfil their captain's and their own greed. Forays into the dungeons will be broken up by weekly trips to the main island, where players can turn in the artifacts and purchase equipment. Each in-game week after the crew has successfully raided a few dungeons the profit quota will increase, forcing the player to delve deeper into the dungeons to collect items of higher rarity. The game will have multiple game modes for single- and multiplayer gameplay.

## How is it Different from Existing Games?
*Intemperance* borrows limitations and conditions from "extraction" - style games and puts them into a context of a rogue-lite RPG in an attempt to reinvigorate the roguelike niche of games. Unlike in *Lethal Company,* the players will be able to equip their characters with more effective weapons and fight monsters instead of having to run away all the time.
